# Mission Statement



# Problem 1: Too many trading cards to organize without a tool
## Problem Statement 1:
Trading card collectors lack ways to efficiently organize data about their cards. For example, many different current trading card apps, such as Archidekt, require users to manually select each unique print of their card, as well as search for the name of the card. Dextcg is a mobile-required app that is inaccessible to those without an iOS device or a phone. If the user does not have an iOS device or wishes to access data on a computer, prior preferred solutions may not be applicable. How can we design an accessible web application to address input efficiency and prioritize user experience?

## Problem Statement 2:
Trading card collectors enjoy having organized collections, which can be tedious to do by hand. Going through a large bulk of cards while having to cross-reference a database manually is unenjoyable for many collectors, but they often still like to have that information and organization for their cards. Going through cards by hand can be inaccurate, time-consuming, and boring. How can we design an automated system to analyze card bulk and help users organize their trading cards?

# Problem 2: Getting homework done on time
## Problem Statement 1:
Some students have trouble keeping assignment due dates organized and lack a schedule. For example, almost all students are enrolled in multiple classes, some with variable or undefined deadlines. Physical notebooks or other planner apps sometimes aren’t enough to create a schedule. These solutions lack ways to create a structured plan that the student sticks to. How can we design a web planner app to assist students in creating a schedule that helps them succeed in school?

## Problem Statement 2:
Students prefer to have a good schedule with their class due dates lined up. Since classes have different due dates and times, it can be difficult for a student to keep track of their assignment progress. In college settings, many classes use online resources to keep track of due dates, and using an online planner can be easy to connect to other online sources. How can we streamline the connection between due dates and planning to help students succeed?

## Build Instructions:
+ Download repository.
  + Use 'main' branch for most reliable deployment.
+ If node.js is not installed, install node from [Node](https://nodejs.org).
+ In directory, run `npm install`.
+ Then, run `npm start` to launch the application.
