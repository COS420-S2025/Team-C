# Mission Statement
### Too many trading cards to organize without a tool

## Problem Statements
### Problem Statement 1:
Trading card collectors lack ways to efficiently organize data about their cards. For example, many different current trading card apps, such as Archidekt, require users to manually select each unique print of their card, as well as search for the name of the card. Dextcg is a mobile-required app that is inaccessible to those without an iOS device or a phone. If the user does not have an iOS device or wishes to access data on a computer, prior preferred solutions may not be applicable. How can we design an accessible web application to address input efficiency and prioritize user experience?

### Problem Statement 2:
Trading card collectors enjoy having organized collections, which can be tedious to do by hand. Going through a large bulk of cards while having to cross-reference a database manually is unenjoyable for many collectors, but they often still like to have that information and organization for their cards. Going through cards by hand can be inaccurate, time-consuming, and boring. How can we design an automated system to analyze card bulk and help users organize their trading cards?

# Build Instructions:
+ Download repository.
  + Use 'main' branch for most reliable deployment.
+ If node.js is not installed, install node from [Node](https://nodejs.org).
+ In directory, run `npm install`.
+ Then, run `npm start` to launch the application.
