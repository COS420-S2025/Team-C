# OVERALL PROBLEM: Too many trading cards to organize without a tool
Trading card collectors lack ways to efficiently organize data about their cards. For example, many different current trading card apps, such as Archidekt, require users to manually select each unique print of their card, as well as search for the name of the card. Dextcg is a mobile-required app that is inaccessible to those without an iOS device or a phone. If the user does not have an iOS device or wishes to access data on a computer, prior preferred solutions may not be applicable. How can we design an accessible web application to address input efficiency and prioritize user experience?
